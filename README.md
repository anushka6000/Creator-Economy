The repository consists of the pdf of the group project.

# Motivation
Creator Economy consists of 50 million independent content creators, curators, and community builders including social media influencers, bloggers, and videographers, plus the software and finance tools designed to help them with growth and monetization. Around 2 million of these content creators are professionals whereas the rest are amateurs.

It is the fastest-growing sector of small businesses. These content creators earn money using platforms such as  YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitch, TikTok, Substack, and Patreon. The total size of the creator economy is estimated to be a little over $100 billion dollars. With a shift to remote work, many people see the creator economy as a chance to do what they love as a part-time job. As such, this sector continued to grow even during the COVID-19 pandemic.

# Task
The task of this case study is to understand the breadth and depth of the creator economy and present the findings. The case is divided into two parts: first for understanding the breadth of creator economy, and second for choosing platforms in order to explore the depth of creator economy.

Part A: The project analyzes the breadth of Creator economy and answers the following question:
1. What is the creator economy? 
2. How does this economy function? 
3. Why is it relevant in todayâ€™s world? 
4. What are the typical business and revenue models followed by the content creators?
5. What are the typical costs involved and what are the expected earnings for the content creators?


Part B: To analyze the depth of Creator Economy, two early-stage (seed / series A funded) startups working in this space were chosen and their potential was evaluated based on the following:
1. TAM (Total available market)
2. Team
3. USP (Unique Selling Point) / Moat 
4. Unit economics
